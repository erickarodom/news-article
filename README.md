This was my first project while attending CodeTalk frontend developement bootcamp. 
The primary purpose of this assignment was to practice semantic HTML, basic CSS and practice CSS layout using the float property.
This assignment was great practice with these basic concepts and was challenging at the time.
CSS float can be tricky and frustrating, having and understanding of its purpose (wrapping text around and image) is good practice
to avoid its over use.
Remember the main use for the CSS float property is image layout and wrapping text around images.
